**Labor Market Power in Food Retailing**. <span style="color:#AA6666">Job Market Paper.</span><br/>

I study the extent and evolution of labor market power in the US food retailing sector by estimating the wedge between workers' marginal productivity and wage. Using data on a near universe of publicly trading American food retailers for the period 2004-2022, I first examine how concentration in labor markets moderates effects of state minimum wages on individual store's employment. On two proxies of labor market concentration---population density and number of establishments---I find that highly concentrated markets have more positive employment effects from minimum wages. Based on this model-free result, I hypothesize that labor oligopsony power enables food retailers in concentrated markets to maintain greater productivity-wage gaps, allowing them to absorb minimum wage increases by sacrificing some surplus while still expanding employment. To test this hypothesis, I implement a production function estimation strategy from IO literature which lets me estimate the labor markdowns or wage-productivity gaps, and understand how they differ by concentration levels. I then examine how these markdown estimates vary across years and along worker, firm, and market characteristics.

Retail food prices rose dramatically in late 2021. Some argue that this “food price inflation” was due to “greedflation” or firms increasing downstream prices simply because they can. In this study, we investigate the sources of “overshifting” store-level cost shocks into downstream prices, or the apparent ability of retailers to pass along price increases that are proportionately larger than increases in cost. We use exogenous changes in minimum wages as our setting, and study how food retailers pass increases
in labor costs along to consumers in the form of higher food prices. We derive a new theoretical model of retail price pass-through, and show that demand curvature, market power, and consumer search behavior each likely affect observed rates of retail price pass-through. Our structural analysis shows that, after controlling for the primary determinants of wage pass-through, market power and demand curvature explain much of the variation in cost pass-through, although general price inflation has an important
role in accentuating the rate of minimum-wage pass-through. Our findings have important implications for minimum wage policy, and for understanding the role of cost shocks in food price inflation.

    <i>"Superstar firms"</i> can be large and successful without necessarily exploiting labor market power (Autor et al. 2020). This paper examines that idea in the context of U.S. agriculture by studying how wages relate to employment surplus—defined as the gap between a worker’s value marginal product and their wage. We estimate a structural search-match-bargaining model to quantify how productivity and bargaining power determine surplus allocation. Results show average productivity of $8.67/hour, with workers capturing 24.2% of the surplus on average, and significant heterogeneity across individuals. Workers generating higher surplus tend to retain a larger share. Contrary to a "winner-take-all" narrative, our findings suggest that firms may gain more by paying higher wages, rather than extracting surplus through monopsony power.

**Retail Concentration and Wages** (with Timothy J. Richards and Keenan Marchesi). <br/>
<span style="color:#AA6666">Revise and Resubmit, Review of Industrial Organization.</span> <br/>

 Antitrust policy in the U.S. now explicitly includes labor-market outcomes as measures of interest when considering the potential anticompetitive effects of mergers or acquisitions. Concentration in the food retailing industry is of particular concern due to several recent high-profile mergers, and a troubling increase in concentration at the national and local levels. We study this problem using both causal reduced-form models and a structural model of search, match, and bargaining. Our reduced-form models show no relationship between concentration and wages, but our structural model finds that concentration is associated with substantial wage suppression.

**Cross-Platform Merger Effects**. <br/>

<div id="platforms_mergers" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>

 Mergers and acquisitions tend to affect the prices and varieties offered by the merging firms. However, most of the existing research considers mergers between firms that interact on the same platform, such as between two online firms, or two firms on the same physical platform. To our knowledge, there is no empirical research on the price effects of integration across different platforms. Such cross-platform mergers likely have substantially different impacts on prices because indirect network effects are much weaker for physical firms than those that interact in low-cost environments having long-tail effects due to lower search costs and fewer constraints on physical inventory. We investigate this problem by analyzing the effects of an acquisition of a national grocery chain by a large online retailer in the United States. Our study differs from prior studies on mergers and acquisitions as the incentives to merge involve not
only the usual market power and efficiency arguments, but accessing stronger, indirect network externalities as well. Because the decision to merge is endogenous, identifying merger effects is empirically difficult. We use a doubly-robust causal inference method
to address this problem, and we find an evidence of a decrease in price levels in 8 out of 10 treated markets.
