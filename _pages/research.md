 Antitrust policy in the U.S. now explicitly includes labor-market outcomes as measures of interest when considering the potential anticompetitive effects of mergers or acquisitions. Concentration in the food retailing industry is of particular concern due to several recent high-profile mergers, and a troubling increase in concentration at the national and local levels. We study this problem using both causal reduced-form models and a structural model of search, match, and bargaining. Our reduced-form models show no relationship between concentration and wages, but our structural model finds that concentration is associated with substantial wage suppression.

 Price inflation rose dramatically in late 2021. While there were many potential causes, some point to rising minimum wages, and wage inflation, as perhaps the most important source of food-price inflation. There is a large body of research that studies the aggregate effects of minimum wages, but none consider the precise mechanisms that link higher food prices and minimum wages in an environment of high general price inflation. In this study, we investigate the possibility that general price inflation serves as a facilitating mechanism for localized price inflation. We estimate both reducedform and structural models of minimum-wage pass-through. Reduced-form models show that general price inflation has a positive effect on minimum wage pass-through to retail food prices. However, reduced-form models cannot account for the effects of demand curvature and imperfect competition. Our structural model shows that, after controlling for the primary determinants of wage pass-through, general price inflation has an important role in accentuating the rate of minimum-wage pass-through. Our findings have important implications for minimum wage policy, and for understanding the role of labor cost in retail price inflation.

**Labor Monopsony in the US Food Retailing Industry**. 2024.<br/>

 I study the extent and evolution of labor market power in the US food retailing sector by estimating the wedge between marginal productivity and wage. Using data on a near universe of American food retailers and market-level worker information for the period 2004-2022, I first examine the effects of rise in concentration from mergers on labor market outcomes. To understand the mechanisms behind the effects, I build a structural model based on the production function approach and estimate labor markdowns as a function of concentration. I then examine how these markdown estimates vary across years and along worker, firm, and market characteristics.

**Monopsony in US Agricultural Labor Markets**. 2024.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('monop_ag')">Abstract</a> | Draft coming soon] </small>

<div id="monop_ag" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>

 I examine labor monopsony power in the US agriculture using 30 years of nationally-representative survey data on crop workers. First, I study relationship between minimum wages and employment of agricultrual workers. In the perfectly competitive market structure, any binding minimum wages result in under-employment. Theoretical literature on labor economics suggests that as firms gain monopsony power, they can make adjustments when there is a binding minimum wage, so employment can still increase. As the first model-free test of monopsony power, I examine whether minimum wage results in higher employment, and if it does, I conclude that agricultural workers are subject to employer market power. In the next step, I build and estimate a model of search, match, and bargaining to explain these reduced-form results. I examine whether there is a monopsony wedge in coherence with the model's predictions, that is whether and how much wages differ from marginal productivity in the competitive benchmark.

**Cross-Platform Merger Effects**. 2023. <br/>

 Mergers and acquisitions tend to affect the prices and varieties offered by the merging firms. However, most of the existing research considers mergers between firms that interact on the same platform, such as between two online firms, or two firms on the same physical platform. To our knowledge, there is no empirical research on the price effects of integration across different platforms. Such cross-platform mergers likely have substantially different impacts on prices because indirect network effects are much weaker for physical firms than those that interact in low-cost environments having long-tail effects due to lower search costs and fewer constraints on physical inventory. We investigate this problem by analyzing the effects of an acquisition of a national grocery chain by a large online retailer in the United States. Our study differs from prior studies on mergers and acquisitions as the incentives to merge involve not
only the usual market power and efficiency arguments, but accessing stronger, indirect network externalities as well. Because the decision to merge is endogenous, identifying merger effects is empirically difficult. We use a doubly-robust causal inference method
to address this problem, and we find an evidence of a decrease in price levels in 8 out of 10 treated markets.
