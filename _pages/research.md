I study the extent and evolution of labor market power in the US food retailing sector by estimating the wedge between workers' marginal productivity and wage. Using data on a near universe of publicly trading American food retailers for the period 2004-2022, I first examine how concentration in labor markets moderates effects of state minimum wages on individual store's employment. On two proxies of labor market concentration---population density and number of establishments---I find that highly concentrated markets have more positive employment effects from minimum wages. Based on this model-free result, I hypothesize that labor oligopsony power enables food retailers in concentrated markets to maintain greater productivity-wage gaps, allowing them to absorb minimum wage increases by sacrificing some surplus while still expanding employment. To test this hypothesis, I implement a production function estimation strategy from IO literature which lets me estimate the labor markdowns or wage-productivity gaps, and understand how they differ by concentration levels. I then examine how these markdown estimates vary across years and along worker, firm, and market characteristics.

 Price inflation rose dramatically in late 2021. While there were many potential causes, some point to rising minimum wages, and wage inflation, as perhaps the most important source of food-price inflation. There is a large body of research that studies the aggregate effects of minimum wages, but none consider the precise mechanisms that link higher food prices and minimum wages in an environment of high general price inflation. In this study, we investigate the possibility that general price inflation serves as a facilitating mechanism for localized price inflation. We estimate both reducedform and structural models of minimum-wage pass-through. Reduced-form models show that general price inflation has a positive effect on minimum wage pass-through to retail food prices. However, reduced-form models cannot account for the effects of demand curvature and imperfect competition. Our structural model shows that, after controlling for the primary determinants of wage pass-through, general price inflation has an important role in accentuating the rate of minimum-wage pass-through. Our findings have important implications for minimum wage policy, and for understanding the role of labor cost in retail price inflation.

''Superstar firms'' can be large and successful without necessarily exploiting market power over labor markets (Autor et al. 2020). In this paper, we examine this idea in an agricultural labor market setting by studying the empirical relationship between employment surplus, which is essentially the excess of a worker's value marginal product over their wage, and wages. We use a model of search, match, and bargaining that explains how the surplus from worker's productivity is split between workers and employers. Our estimates show that workers' mean productivity is $8.67 per hour, and they receive 24.2% of employment surplus, but both exhibit substantial heterogeneity over workers. Heterogeneity in productivity and bargaining power suggests that workers who are able to generate ''a bigger pie'', may also earn a larger share of it. Consistent with this notion, our analysis shows a robust positive elasticity of surplus with observed wages, implying that agricultural firms gain more (surplus) by paying their workers higher wages and not necessarily through exploitation or ``winner-take-all'' strategy.

**Retail Concentration and Wages** (with Tim Richards and Keenan Marchesi). 2024. _<span style="color:#AA6666">Under Review.</span>_ <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('concen_wages')">Abstract</a> | [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4815715) ] </small>

<div id="concen_wages" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>

 Antitrust policy in the U.S. now explicitly includes labor-market outcomes as measures of interest when considering the potential anticompetitive effects of mergers or acquisitions. Concentration in the food retailing industry is of particular concern due to several recent high-profile mergers, and a troubling increase in concentration at the national and local levels. We study this problem using both causal reduced-form models and a structural model of search, match, and bargaining. Our reduced-form models show no relationship between concentration and wages, but our structural model finds that concentration is associated with substantial wage suppression.

**Cross-Platform Merger Effects**. 2023. <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('platforms_mergers')">Abstract</a> | [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4976777) ] </small>

<div id="platforms_mergers" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>

 Mergers and acquisitions tend to affect the prices and varieties offered by the merging firms. However, most of the existing research considers mergers between firms that interact on the same platform, such as between two online firms, or two firms on the same physical platform. To our knowledge, there is no empirical research on the price effects of integration across different platforms. Such cross-platform mergers likely have substantially different impacts on prices because indirect network effects are much weaker for physical firms than those that interact in low-cost environments having long-tail effects due to lower search costs and fewer constraints on physical inventory. We investigate this problem by analyzing the effects of an acquisition of a national grocery chain by a large online retailer in the United States. Our study differs from prior studies on mergers and acquisitions as the incentives to merge involve not
only the usual market power and efficiency arguments, but accessing stronger, indirect network externalities as well. Because the decision to merge is endogenous, identifying merger effects is empirically difficult. We use a doubly-robust causal inference method
to address this problem, and we find an evidence of a decrease in price levels in 8 out of 10 treated markets.
