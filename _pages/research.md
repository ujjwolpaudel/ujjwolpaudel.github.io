    Retail food prices rose dramatically in late 2021. Some argue that this “food price inflation” was due to “greedflation” or firms increasing downstream prices simply because they can. In this study, we investigate the sources of “overshifting” store-level cost shocks into downstream prices, or the apparent ability of retailers to pass along price increases that are proportionately larger than increases in cost. We use exogenous changes in minimum wages as our setting, and study how food retailers pass increases in labor costs along to consumers in the form of higher food prices. We derive a new theoretical model of retail price pass-through, and show that demand curvature, market power, and consumer search behavior each likely affect observed rates of retail price pass-through. Our structural analysis shows that, after controlling for the primary determinants of wage pass-through, market power and demand curvature explain much of the variation in cost pass-through, although general price inflation has an important role in accentuating the rate of minimum-wage pass-through. Our findings have important implications for minimum wage policy, and for understanding the role of cost shocks in food price inflation.

    <i>"Superstar firms"</i> can be large and successful without necessarily exploiting labor market power (Autor et al. 2020). This paper examines that idea in the context of U.S. agriculture by studying how wages relate to employment surplus—defined as the gap between a worker’s value marginal product and their wage. We estimate a structural search-match-bargaining model to quantify how productivity and bargaining power determine surplus allocation. Results show average productivity of $8.67/hour, with workers capturing 24.2% of the surplus on average, and significant heterogeneity across individuals. Workers generating higher surplus tend to retain a larger share. Contrary to a "winner-take-all" narrative, our findings suggest that firms may gain more by paying higher wages, rather than extracting surplus through monopsony power.

**Retail Concentration and Wages** (with Timothy J. Richards and Keenan Marchesi). <br/>
<span style="color:#AA6666">Revised and Resubmitted, Review of Industrial Organization.</span> <br/>

 Antitrust policy in the U.S. now explicitly includes labor-market outcomes as measures of interest when considering the potential anticompetitive effects of mergers or acquisitions. Concentration in the food retailing industry is of particular concern due to several recent high-profile mergers, and a troubling increase in concentration at the national and local levels. We study this problem using both causal reduced-form models and a structural model of search, match, and bargaining. Our reduced-form models show no relationship between concentration and wages, but our structural model finds that concentration is associated with substantial wage suppression.

**Cost Shocks and Price Pass-through**. <br/>

 The question of how firms pass changes in their input costs to consumer prices is an important and a long-standing puzzle in economics. I study this problem by exploring the impacts in retail prices due to cost shocks from increases in state minimum wage. Using spatial distribution of minimum wages in the United States, NielsenIQ's scanner transaction data from 2011-2021, and a stacked difference-indifferences research design, I find that a 10 percent increase in state minimum wage causes 1.1 to 1.5 percent increase in retail grocery prices. I also find evidence that food retailers exhibit forward-looking behavior by adjusting prices immediately after minimum wage legislation is enacted, rather than waiting until the policy is formally implemented. Additionally, I use a causal machine learning approach to examine the heterogeneity of the minimum wage price pass-through along different retailer-and market-specific covariates. I find that pass-through rates are lower among retailers with greater market share and in higher-income counties, which implies that larger firms and richer markets can absorb cost shocks better. Further, retailers with lower reliance on promotions and discounts exhibit higher pass-through, which suggests that price adjustments can also occur through changes in discounting strategies rather than solely through base price increases. My findings highlight the need for policymakers and marketing practitioners to consider the distributional effects of minimum wage policies on firms' pricing decisions.

**Labor Market Power in Food Retailing**. <span style="color:#AA6666">Preparing for Submission.</span><br/>


<!-- <div id="monop_retail" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>

I study the extent and evolution of labor market power in the US food retailing sector by estimating the wedge between workers' marginal productivity and wage. Using data on a near universe of publicly trading American food retailers for the period 2004-2022, I first examine how concentration in labor markets moderates effects of state minimum wages on individual store's employment. On two proxies of labor market concentration---population density and number of establishments---I find that highly concentrated markets have more positive employment effects from minimum wages. Based on this model-free result, I hypothesize that labor oligopsony power enables food retailers in concentrated markets to maintain greater productivity-wage gaps, allowing them to absorb minimum wage increases by sacrificing some surplus while still expanding employment. To test this hypothesis, I implement a production function estimation strategy from IO literature which lets me estimate the labor markdowns or wage-productivity gaps, and understand how they differ by concentration levels. I then examine how these markdown estimates vary across years and along worker, firm, and market characteristics.

**Cross-Platform Merger Effects** (with Timothy J. Richards). <span style="color:#AA6666">Preparing for Submission.</span><br/>

<div id="platforms_mergers" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>

Mergers and acquisitions tend to affect the prices and varieties offered by the merging firms. Most existing research, however, focuses on mergers between firms operating on the same platform, such as between two online firms or two firms in the same physical channel. In contrast, the price effects of integration across different platforms remain unexplored in empirical research but are likely of critical importance given the growth of omnichannel, or combined physical and online channels, retailing. We study this question by analyzing the acquisition of a national grocery chain by a large online retailer in the United States. Unlike prior studies on same-platform merger, this merger involves both traditional market power and efficiency motives, as well as the potential for cross-platform network externalities. Identifying price effects is further challenging due to the endogenous nature of merger decisions. We use a doubly-robust synthetic control method and find that prices decrease in four out of 10 treated markets, while in five markets, prices remain unchanged. Unlike in same-platform horizontal mergers, these price effects do not systematically vary with market concentration levels and challenge predictions from the Structure-Conduct-Performance literature. Therefore, in cross-platform mergers, competitive effects likely reflect forces beyond market structure, such as channel complementarities and consumer substitution.
