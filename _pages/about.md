Prior to joining ASU, I studied mathematics at [ETH Zürich](https://math.ethz.ch) and [Jacobs University Bremen](http://math.jacobs-university.de), where I completed my MS and BS, respectively. 

I originally come from a [village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budhabare,_Jhapa) in south-eastern Nepal.
