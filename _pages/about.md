I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Supply Chain Management at [Arizona State University](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/supply-chain-management-degrees).

Broadly, I study competition in product and labor markets through the lens of industrial organization economics to untangle pricing on digital platforms, bargaining in last-mile delivery, and buyer–supplier dynamics in vertical relationships.

I am on the job market in the 2025–2026 academic year.
